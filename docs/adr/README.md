## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows the template in `0000-template.md`:

1. **Title** - Short noun phrase
2. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context** - The issue motivating the decision
4. **Decision** - The change being proposed
5. **Consequences** - Positive, negative, and neutral effects
6. **Alternatives** - Other options considered and why rejected

## Creating a New ADR

```
